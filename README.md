# Improved Contrastive Clustering
CS 4262 : Final Project : Learning Better Embeddings for Contrastive Methods for Online Image Clustering using regularized Embedding Space.

## TODO : 
- ~~Implement the Train Functions~~
- ~~Implement Transforms~~
- ~~Implement data loaders~~ 
  - ~~MNIST~~
  - ~~CIFAR10~~
  - ~~CIFAR100~~
- ~~Implement Scores : [ACC, ARI, NMI]~~
- ~~Implement Logging.~~
- ~~Plot the MNIST Embedding Space as a unit sphere.~~
- ~~Add the regularizer to the loss.~~
- ~~Plot the new MNIST Embedding Space as a unit sphere.~~
- ~~Freeze the resnet and perform Elbow Method to find the optimal K after training on K = 5.~~
